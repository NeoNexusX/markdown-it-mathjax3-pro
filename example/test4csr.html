    <p>Direction cosines are a very common concept in vectors, used to specify the direction of a vector. This might sound confusing at first, but don't worry, we'll use diagrams to understand it.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the figure below, there is a coordinate system xoy, which looks like this:</p>
<p>It contains a vector $\overrightarrow{l}$, with coordinates: $(a,b)$</p>
<p>The vector mentioned above satisfies the following equation:</p>
<p>$$
(\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}},\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}})
$$</p>
<p>The equation above is actually normalizing the vector. The newly generated vector is what we commonly call a <strong>direction vector</strong>.</p>
<p>The direction vector can actually be further optimized. We can see that there are two marked angles in the figure, namely $\alpha$ and $\beta$. I won't elaborate on their relationship, but they are a pair of complementary angles that satisfy the condition of adding up to 90 degrees.</p>
<p>At this point, we can transform this equation into the following form:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} = \cos{\alpha}
$$</p>
